# Predictioncompetitions 

Mostly kaggle competition entries or kernels that I ran.

- Titanic analysis and random forest classification (very first serious try with machine learning)
- House price prediction (advanced feature engineering and ensembling)
- Pump it Up! driven data pump repair prediction competition (https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/page/23/)
